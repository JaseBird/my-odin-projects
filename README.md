[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (**TOP**) provides a free open source web development curriculum. This repository serves as a compilation and showcase for all the projects that I have completed as part of the curriculum.

## Curriculum
The curriculum is split into 2 sections: **Foundations** and **Full Stack**.

You can either navigate to the individual sections for more details, or view a summary of the full list of projects in table format below.

**Navigation** 🥈: [Foundations](https://github.com/JaseBird/my-odin-projects/edit/main/README.md) | 🥇: [Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/JaseBird/my-odin-projects/edit/main/README.md)

## Full Project List
With the exception of styling and additional noted features, most projects have been left as is. Any additional features implemented are noted in the project's README, and are not typically required by the project specifications in The Odin Project. This is typically noted by the ⭐ Rating column.

This is to accurately reflect my knowledge of web development at the point of tackling the project. Future learners of The Odin Project will also be able to see what is a fair expectation of the finished project.

⭐ **Rating Definitions**
- Empty: Meets minimum requirements, minimum styling
- ⭐: Effort has been applied to styling, some low effort additional features
- ⭐⭐: Has additional features applied, some edge cases have been tested for
- ⭐⭐⭐: Proud of these. Comprehensive feature set and well tested. A keystone piece! ✨

🥈 **Foundations**

> [!NOTE]
> I created seperate repositories for the foundation projects as I learned to use github, I have since moved them all into this mono-repository but lost the original commit history. When viewing the commits for these projects ignore the date/time stamps. The full stack project commit history will be valid.

🥇 **Full Stack Ruby on Rails**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am currently working on the foundations section of the course, once I progress to full stack I will update this page to reflect my progress.

## Commit types
The commit type can include the following:
- **build**: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **chore**: changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
- **ci**: continuous integration related
- **docs**: updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
- **feat**: a new feature is introduced with the changes
- **fix**: a bug fix has occurred
- **perf**: performance improvements
- **refactor**: refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **revert**: reverts a previous commit
- **style**: changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semicolons, and so on.
- **test**: including new or correcting previous tests
